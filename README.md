Generative adversarial networks take advantage of adversarial processes and train two neural networks which compete with each other until the 
desired equilibrium is achieved.
- Generator Network G(Z) takes the random noise as input and generates data relatable to our dataset.
- Discriminator Network D(Z) takes the data generated by G(Z) and discriminates between the real data and generated data.
- Equilibrium: Generator should model the real data and Discriminator should output the probability of 0.5 as the generated data is same as the real data -- that is, it is not sure if the new data coming from the generator is real or fake with equal probability.
- Objective: To learn a new function that can generate data from the same distribution as the training data.
1. basic function to generate a quadratic distribution (the real data distribution)
2. Generator
3. Discriminator
4. Train.
